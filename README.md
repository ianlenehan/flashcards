### Functionality

Users can log into the website and begin by either creating their own index cards, assigned to both a category and a deck (collection), or they can browse categories and decks created by other users.

Decks can be marked as Favourite, which can be accessed from the favourites shortcut.

Cards within other decks can be added to a user's deck and can therefore exist in multiple decks.

The testing of your memory is built as a game, where users are given a score for the number of right answers. The more you play, the higher you push your lifetime score. There are 10 levels of achievement based upon the number of points a user scores, and a lifetime leaderboard can be viewed on the home page.
